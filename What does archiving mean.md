Engaging Archives
  
   In my Lexical Database Archiving Questionnaire I begin to talk about engaging archives to find out which archives have
   lexical databases and what languages they are describing. During the initial stages of this discussion there are
   several issues or questions which have come to the surface which deserve an answer. I will do my best to record these
   thoughts here (please realize that this page will be updated periodically).
                                      
Why not look at OLAC?

   Short answer: We do and have.

   This is a great question, I have and I do search OLAC records. I will be posting more about the role OLAC records have
   had in this project.
                                      
   So far I can say:
    1. Not every organization (archive) submits the same kind of records. - (project records vs. item records)
    2. When institutions do provide multiple records for the same item (describing different scopes of the object) then
       these records are not always clearly linked.
    3. Not all records are tagged the same way within the same organizations. -
    4. Not all institutions, nor all records from some institutions have the minimum valid metadata for the OLAC 1.1
       standard.
    5. Some organizations prevent this level (Lexical Database) of metadata from being distributed by policy - (SIL).
    6. Sometimes "Toolbox files" when mentioned in records refer to text markups rather than lexical datasets.
    7. Not all OLAC data providers provide end pages to the items they mention (Hawai'i, TLA, U-de, etc.)
                                
What about privacy? When asking archives to divulge their records, sometimes archives can only provide general information,
not as detailed as you are currently asking for.

   Short answer: If it is too sensitive to let the world know it exists, then don't share it with us.

   This is another great point. It deserves a detailed answer. I have put it on its own page. You can find what I would
   suggest is a simple taxonomy of archive resources on its own page. The Taxonomy of Archivable Resources and their
   publicity levels. According to this taxonomy, we are interested in anything that would fit in Grey, Yellow, and Green
   boxes. We are not interested in anything which would fit in the Red box.

What is 'an Archive'?

   This question is asked more than I initially thought it would be. It deserves an answer.

   The following questions are often asked by individuals but also pertain to institutions as well.

What is a lexical Resource?

   Short answer: It varies.

   This is an important question. I don't have all the answers. As I get them, I will modify my page here, which
   discusses this issue.
        
What is the difference between archiving and back-up?
        
   Date added: 13. December 2013
   Short answer: Back-up protects us from data-loss, whereas archiving inducts the data into practices of: data
   preservation, formal description, systematic access, and data protection.
   Show Long Answer
   Archiving and Back-up are different.
   First lets explain what we mean by, "Copy" and "Back-up" and then we will contrast this with what we mean by
   "Archive". In the IT industry there are generally three kinds of Back-up (explained below). Additionally, we often see
   the word "archive" associated with IT products. e.g. Google Mail (Gmail) has a feature called "archive", as do many
   IMAP email systems. Amazon Cloud Storage promotes their some of their data storage products as being "good for
   'archiving'". We take issue with how the term is used in these contexts and clarify what we mean by archiving below.
        
   'Copy' and 'Back-up'
    1. Same Drive - Onsite :: we call this a Copy. - If your computer is stolen or the drive goes bad both "copies" are
       lost. This is not a back-up.
    2. Separate Drive - Onsite :: This is where a copy of the data lives on a second drive, but the drive is in the same
       location as you computer where the file exists. If one of the two drives dies then the data is recoverable from
       the second drive. However, because both drives are in the same location, it is highly probable that if there was a
       catastrophic event: Fire, Explosion (war), or theft, that both devices would be rendered unusable. An example of
       this kind of back-up solution for OS X is Time-Machine.
    3. Separate Drive - Offsite :: This kind of back-up solution may come in two varieties: (1) Same Region or (2)
       Different Region.
          + Same Region works like this: The person backing things up takes the drive and makes a back-up copy and passes
            the drive off to a custodian who stores the drive (and data) entrusted to them in a secondary location in
            some other part of the city or small country. Often for this to work well, it must be done at regular
            intervals. In one language documentation project Hugh Paterson was involved in he used Time-Machine and
            replaced data on the offsite disk weekly. - Note: many linguistic field projects, including SIL entities
            around the world have solutions at this level.
          + Different Region works like this: The person backing things up (usually) uses a dynamic service which stores
            a copy of their hard drive in one or more data centers. There are several commercial services which work like
            this but all function slightly different. For example: CrashPlanPROe, Carbonite, or RebuSync (though RebuSync
            as of 2010 did not keep versions of files, and was difficult to work with the large file size of primary data
            in a language documentation project). At this level of back-up solution, if a datacenter in a hurricane zone
            like Florida was destroyed, then the data would be expected to be stored somewhere else like Los Angles, or
            Tokyo. The data could then be restored or accessed from this second location.
       Note: What about Google Drive, Sugar Sync, or DropBox aren't these back-up solutions? No. We would not classify 
       these as back-up solutions. We classify them as collaboration and file sharing solutions. Here is why: when these
       kinds of solutions are used they, (typically) sync materials from your computer to the user's cloud account. If a
       user accidentally deletes their content from their computer then this deletion is also replicated to these remote
       file stores. Thereby also deleting the file in the offsite location. (We recognize that some services do offer
       versioning which does give users limited capability to recover deleted files, but these features are not
       automatic, and usually come bundled with premium version of these products/services.)
   
   So then what does 'Archived' mean and how is it different from 'Back-up'? - Whereas back-up is primarily concerned
   with data loss prevention, Archiving is concerned with preservation of usability (of the data), discoverability,
   provenance (history) and identification (of the data), and then also access to data.
   
If my Data is in the cloud does that mean it is archived?
   
   Date added: 13. December 2013
   Short answer: No.
   Show Long Answer
   This is also a great question, because there are a lot of issues involved with cloud data. First cloud data is often
   social, and implies variation though versions (updates or changes to the same dataset) and forks (dataset splits where
   each set is then modified independently). Second cloud data is not on the local machine and therefore can feel to some like an "offsite back-up" solution.
   
   With regards to lexical datasets SIL offers two independent cloud services:
     * languagedepot.org - A web service which enables the send and receive functions of lexical dataset building teams
       to share their data with each other through FLEx's built in Send/Receive function.  
     * webonary.org - A website where FLEx data can be hosted and viewed.

   First lets address the cloud
   social data and the iterative nature of lexical resources. There are lots of tools like DropBox, SugarSync, Google
   Drive, etc. These are not necessarily even successful back-up strategies.
