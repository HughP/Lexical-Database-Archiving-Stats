# Formulas

Stats are not my strong point. I consulted with three friends *A, M, & Z* to look at which formulas to use. Here is what I decided in prose.

## Formula for network equivlency hypothesis
Sent out a survey to several hundred people. On several mailing lists. Several hundred people (176) at last count, responded to several questions. 96 of these respondents were by SIL staff, while 80 respondents were by persons not affilitated with SIL.
