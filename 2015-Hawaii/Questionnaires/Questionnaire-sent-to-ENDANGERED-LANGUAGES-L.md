# Questionnaire sent to ENDANGERED-LANGUAGES-L@listserv.linguistlist.org


In early 2013 the SIL Language and Culture Archive looked at content submitted during 2012.  One interesting thing to note was that during 2012 only 4 FLEx databases were archived (in addition to about 6 ToolBox databases).

We have a nagging question: *is this normal (that so few lexical database users archive their data), or are there really this few FLEx and Toolbox users?* To this end Hugh Paterson has put together a short survey (4-ish simple questions - requires about 3 minutes). It is available online here: http://bit.ly/19QSPMb

For those in a bandwidth restricted situation feel free to reply to the questions below with answers to: Hugh_Paterson [ at ] sil.org
 
Four questions: 
 
1. Are you using FLEx or ToolBox and which version are you using?:
2. What is the ISO 639-3 code of the language you are using it with (analyzing/investigating)?:
3. Have you ever archived a version of your current Lexical Database at an official archive? (An archive like SIL's L & CA -REAP-, or SOAS's ELAR, or MPI's TLA, or PARADISEC. - Though it doesn't have to be one of these four. ) - Yes / No:
4: Have you ever produced a Print or Digital Publication from your Lexical data (like a Glossary or a Dictionary)? if so we would like to hear about it, got a link or a citation?:



-----------------------------------------
One entry per language. If you work with more than one language, feel free to submit one answer per language or add a comment to that effect with a list of the ISO 639-3 codes or language names.
Personal details (email address and name) will be kept confidential, other data and generalizations of trends may be published.

Thank you for the work you do and the effort you make to serve speakers of minority languages.
