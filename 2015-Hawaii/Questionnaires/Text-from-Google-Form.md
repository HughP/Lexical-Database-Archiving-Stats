#Questionnaire about Lexical Database Usage

We are asking a few questions about your current Lexical Database use. 
In 2012, Hugh Paterson and Jeremy Nordmoe did their initial research on the success of RAMP. During that year only 10 Lexical database projects (4 FLEx, 6 ToolBox) had been submitted to the SIL Archive. (See link to research poster after submitting the questionnaire). We are looking to see if that is a trend among all Lexical Database users or just SIL users of FLEx & ToolBox.
