# Lexical-Database-Archiving-Stats
This gihub repository contains scripts, formulas and data used in posters, presentations and papers presented, authored or co-autorhed by Hugh Paterson III on the topic of *User Experince in digital interactions surrounding language archives*.

##Papers, Publications, and Presentations (and notes or additional discussion items)
In chronological order, most recent first, these are:

* Paterson, Hugh J, III. 2015. *Lexical dataset archiving: an assessment of practice*. Poster presented at the 4th International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation, at the University of Hawai’i Mānoa, Honolulu, HI. February 26 – March 1st. Version 1.0

* Paterson, Hugh J, III. 2014. *Language archiving and data ecology*. Presentation at the University of Oregon GLOSS and the Department of Linguistics Colloquium, Eugene, OR, 23 May. [Handout] (http://linguistics.uoregon.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Paterson-Handout.pdf)

* Paterson, Hugh J, III and Jeremy Nordmoe. 2013. *Challenges of implementing a tool to extract metadata from linguists: The use case of RAMP*. Poster presented at SIL-UND, Summer 2013 session in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Version 1.5 (Essentially this is the same poster as presented in Hawai'i, but laid out with differernt dimensions.)

* Paterson, Hugh J, III and Jeremy Nordmoe. 2013. *Challenges of implementing a tool to extract metadata from linguists: The use case of RAMP*. Poster presented at [3rd International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation](http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ICLDC/2013/), at the University of Hawai’i Mānoa, Honolulu, HI. February 28 – March 3rd. Version 1.4 Online at: https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/26178 or http://hdl.handle.net/10125/26178

## Formulas 
Formulas used in the papers and posters about Lexical Database Archiving.
* Hawai'i 2015 - [Formulas used in the Hawai'i 2015 presentation](https://github.com/HughP/Lexical-Database-Archiving-Stats/blob/master/2015-Hawaii/Formulas/Formulas.md)
* Oregon 2014  - Methodologies are mostly the same as Hawai'i 2015 only the data changes
* SIL-UND 2013 - Methodologies are mostly the same and the data is the same as Hawai'i 2013
* Hawai'i 2013 - Not availble yet.

## Scripts
Combinations of R scritps and Python scripts used to process the data and acomplish the goals of the formulas.
* Hawai'i 2015
* Oregon 2014  - Methodologies are mostly the same as Hawai'i 2015 only the data changes
* SIL-UND 2013 - Methodologies are mostly the same and the data is the same as Hawai'i 2013
* Hawai'i 2013 - Not availble yet. (includes Gephi data and use)

## Data
There are several sets of data outlined as follows:
* Archive specific data from SIL International - This is Corporation specific and confidential data and can not be released, but can be discussed in general terms.
* Questionaire response data - This must be anonymized before release, as indicated in the terms of collection. One portion of this data is accessible via: [*Data File 1*](https://github.com/HughP/Lexical-Database-Archiving-Stats/blob/master/2015-Hawaii/data/Anonymized%20Participant%20data%20-%20(about%20data%20file%201).md)
* ISO 639-3 data - This data is openly avaible.
* SIL.org data for GIS locations of languages.

A subset of the questionaire data should be made public and included in this project. However, as indicated above, the data yet needs to be anonymized as much as is possible, to comply with the terms under which it was collected. It is well known in both the linguistics and big-data communities anonomized data can usually be reconstructed to some degree given access and comparison to tertiary data sets. So, even my efforts may not completely obscure retraceable facts.
